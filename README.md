# Port Scanner
The following script uses the socket library to check for open ports on a given IP address and range of ports. 
The script will then scan your localhost for open ports between 20 and 1024, printing the open ones to the console.

 # simple Python script that mimics some of the basic functionalities of nmap. This will not be as feature-rich as nmap itself but should give you an idea of how to scan open ports on a host.
